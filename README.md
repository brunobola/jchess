JChess is jQuery and PHP based multi player chess


Here's how you can see it in action:

Open http://haisum.info/chess/ in chrome and another window in firefox or incognito mode in chrome so that you can log in with two different users.

I made two users haisum1 and haisum2 both having password qwerty

Log in into both windows with different users and invite for game :) You can then move your pieces or drag and drop them. Don't use IE it has many issues in IE and sorry for weird messages and alerts it was a hobby project so left them unfixed :) hope you will like it.
